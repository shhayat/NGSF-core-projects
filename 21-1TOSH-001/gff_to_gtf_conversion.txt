#For converting gff file to gtf AGAT tool was used (https://github.com/NBISweden/AGAT)

#Following steps were used
#step1: Docker image was pulled for agat version 0.9.1
> docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/agat:0.9.1--pl5321hdfd78af_0 

#step:2 - keep bison.liftoff.gff in /tmp directory

> cp bison.liftoff.gff /tmp

#step:3 - bison.liftoff.gff was load/mount within container agat:0.9.1 and the conversion was done using agat_convert_sp_gff2gtf.pl function. The 
#output is stored in 
> cd /tmp

> docker run -v ${PWD}:/agat quay.io/biocontainers/agat:0.9.1--pl5321hdfd78af_0 agat_convert_sp_gff2gtf.pl --gff agat/bison.liftoff.gff -o agat/bison.liftoff.gtf
