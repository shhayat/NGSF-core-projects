Denovo assembly step
For Chromosome denovo assembly
#3 files didn't produce stats for chromosome contig assembly step becasue the time limit was over. Reran those 5 samples with extra time

For Plasmid denovo assembly 
#38 files didn't produce GC_hist and length_hist file. While checking log files for those samples It was figure out that no plasmid contig was 
assembled and the read were corrected by the tool. Now I will use corrected reads for running plasmid contig assembly for those samples
