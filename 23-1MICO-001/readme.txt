Analyzing WES Data
High-quality results in exome analysis are highly associated with how the dataset is processed. Thus, protocols for whole exome sequencing data analysis include several steps such as quality control (QC), raw reads preprocessing, short reads mapping, post-alignment processing, variant calling and annotation, and variant prioritization. Due to the possible presence of contaminants and artifacts such as sequencing errors, low-quality reads, adaptors, and duplicates introduced during the sequencing process, QC metrics assess the quality of the data by generating basic statistical measures regarding depth, coverage, sequence adapter identification, GC content, and base distribution. Basepairâ€™s pipelines implements QC using the fastp tool.

Since artifacts are present in raw data, read preprocessing steps like trimming, filtering, or adaptor clipping are strongly recommended to avoid mapping biases during the reading alignment step. For reads mapping to the reference genome, Basepair supports two leading tools: Bowtie and BWA. Both perform reference-based mapping. Here, critical QC metrics such as depth and coverage of genomic regions are evaluated. After this, post-alignment processing steps remove multi-mapped and duplicated reads to minimize allelic biases during the variant calling step. 

The variant calling step calculates the probability that a genetic variant is truly present in the sample analyzed. One of the most popular software packages for variant calling is GATK. To avoid false-positive SNP calls, it is important to set proper parameters, such as maximum read depth per position, minimum number of gapped reads, and base alignment quality recalculation to improve the base quality called. Additionally, variant annotation aims to integrate relevant information about each variant called. Here, softwares like SnpEff/SnpSift and VEP help annotate variant types, their effects on genes (like changes in amino acids), impact, and frequency of occurrence in human populations (e.g. using the DbSNP database). This information is crucial for performing downstream filtration and prioritization in exome sequencing analysis.

Hundreds to thousands of variants can potentially be obtained from exome sequencing. Here, it is very challenging to reduce the search space for causative variants. Overall, users can sort variants found by effect, impact of mutations, and zygosity. More sophisticated statistical tests might be useful, though they usually require a considerable sample size. As an alternative to direct data filtration, using WES data, users can perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS), phenotype- or genotype-based approaches, gene-specific analysis, and family-based studies depending on the experimental study design.
